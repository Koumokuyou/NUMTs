<h2>Description and display conventions</h2>

<p>Nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments(NUMTs) is a kind of insertion from the mitochondrion to the nucleus, which is an ongoing and frequent process that happens in all eukaryotes. In previous studies, NUMTs have been reported to increase genetic diversity, promote gene and genome evolution, and generate novel nuclear exons. NUMTs can also affect the accuracy when nuclear genomes are assembled.</p>
<p>This track is a collection of Nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments, provided in BED format ignoring the strand.</p>
<b>Notice: Alignments reference to incompletely assembled or unmapped chromosome locations are omitted in this track.</b>
<p>In this track, the score represents the alignment confidence and is reflected in the level of gray. It is important to note that when a NUMTs is a merged result, the score is taken as the highest score among all results.</p>
